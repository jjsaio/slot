Goals
-----

(a) understand throroughly the concepts of semantic rationalization
    and reflection (as implemented in 3-LISP).

(b) assess their general utility in other programming languages,
    particularly as applied to CITW.

in pursuance of (a) and (b) is the sub-goal:

(c) design and implement a new semantically rationalized and
    reflective programming language, based on existing declarative
    PLs (as opposed to functional PLs like LISP)

i believe there is a potential that the notion of semantic clarity
could contribute substantially to my CITW practice; and i can also the
possibility for reflection to be likewise useful. but in neither case
am i yet convinced, mostly because i have still not yet achieved (a).
so, my primary goal is to understand (a) well enough that i embrace
these notions in daily practice -- or consciously decide to abandon
them altogether.
